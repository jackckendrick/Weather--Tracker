# Weather-Tracker
This repository contains the code for a weather forecasting website. 

When searching for a city, the user is presented with the current and future weather conditions for that city. 
The weather conditions displayed for a city include: the date, an icon representing the weather condition, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. 
The future conditions displayed for a specific city include a five day weather forecast displaying: the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
Upon searching for a city, the city gets added to a history list for easy access in the future. 
When the user clicks on a city in the history list, the current and fututre weather conditions will be displayed for that city.
